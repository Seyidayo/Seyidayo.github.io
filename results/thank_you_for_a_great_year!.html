"Hey ITT Fam,<br/> <br/> 2023 is finally coming to a close and it has been one very interesting year, so we figured we&#39;d check in with you all for a final time before we call it curtains&hellip;this year. For a final time this year. We&rsquo;ll be back in 2024, please ðŸ˜….<br/> <br/> For us, this year came with change, new beginnings and many pleasant surprises. It has been nothing short of incredible and we could not be happier that you all walked this journey with us, sticking with us till the very end of the year.<br/> <br/> Our heartfelt thanks do not seem like gratitude enough. As we approach the end of this year, we must use this time to look back on all we have been able to achieve thanks to the support from our ever-growing community and dedicated listeners. <ul> \t<li><strong>New look, Same podcast</strong>: In August, we officially unveiled our new look. Our rebranding came with some minor and major changes to the overall look and feel of the show and even though it was not the easiest thing to let go of the old and bring in the new, we&rsquo;re so glad it was received very well and turned out to be an immense success. Learn more about our rebrand <a href=\"https://insidethetechosystem.com/itt-2-0\">here</a></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <ul> \t<li><strong>A larger family of listeners:</strong>&nbsp;This year, Spotify thought it was a good idea to let us know that we were streamed in over 12 countries and rated 5.0 on their platform ðŸ¦¾. We have you all to thank for that. Sharing, listening, and reposting mean the world to us. Community support is truly one of our greatest assets. We hope we continue to make the show even better for everyone that tunes in. If you haven&rsquo;t rated the show yet, please help us maintain our perfect score by giving it 5 stars and sharing the show with other people so that they can join in on the fun too.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">Rate the show <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2sG9eI3yfUYlmg0GHham87?si=ce4f2e2c8989428a\">here</a></span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <ul> \t<li><strong>The Founder&#39;s Experience</strong>: This is one we&rsquo;re proud of. Our new series: &quot;The Founder&#39;s Experience&quot;&nbsp;boasts of two stellar episodes that our listeners keep replaying over and over. We decided to create a segment on the show for founders to talk about their experience building inside the techosystem and it has been nothing short of great conversations throughout. Next year, we plan to have even more amazing founders who are building interesting stuff stop by for a conversation with us.

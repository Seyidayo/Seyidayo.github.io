"<div>Hey there, ITT fam!<br/> <br/> Do you remember how many times you changed your career path while growing up? At age 5, some of us wanted to be doctors, and by age 12, we decided to become engineers, lawyers, or something else.<br/> <br/> <br/> Even though most of us eventually settled on one profession, we&#39;ve all had phases where we wanted to pursue different or multiple things at once.<br/> <br/> <br/> In our <a href=\"https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/PAL5kFl6kEb\">latest episode</a>, we had a conversation with someone who wanted to be multiple things at once and actually followed through with it.<br/> <br/> <br/> Joining us in the episode is the multi-talented Nissi Ogulu, who has co-founded two startups: one in animation production and another in the electric vehicle industry. We discuss Nissi&#39;s background, and her upbringing filled with curiosity, which eventually led her to study abroad and work for one of the largest companies in the automotive industry.<br/> <br/> We also explore Nissi&#39;s process for generating great ideas, highlight some of her most interesting projects to date, and delve into what motivates her to innovate and contribute to the tech ecosystem continuously.<br/> <br/> Nissi is a fascinating guest, and we&#39;re thrilled to have had the opportunity to explore her mind in this episode. But don&#39;t just take our word for it, you&#39;ll have to listen to the full conversation.<br/> <br/> <br/> If you haven&#39;t already, we encourage you to rate the show on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2sG9eI3yfUYlmg0GHham87\">Spotify</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/inside-the-techosystem/id1524652308\">Apple Podcast</a>.

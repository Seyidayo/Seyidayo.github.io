"<div>Hey there, ITT aficionados!<br/> <br/> How have you been? We hope things have been going okay since we last sent out one of these letters to you. Just in case you were looking for something to brighten up your day, we just released a brand new episode titled <strong>Inside the mind of an Engineering Manager</strong>.<br style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\"/> <br style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\"/> Oftentimes, companies in the techosystem may be tempted to forget completely about engineering management and focus on just engineering. But recently, we&#39;ve been made to believe that most successful products in the techosystem were built by companies with great engineering leadership. That is why in this episode, we invited <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gofaniyi\" style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bolder; color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">Olaoluwa Faniyi</span></a> to chat about Engineering management and leadership.<br/> <br/> He has led and built many engineering teams in his career both home and abroad and has been really successful with many. In this episode, he shares some of the valuable lessons learned from engineering management and some widely unspoken discussions that need to be heard more in the techosystem.<br/> <br/> We hope you enjoy this episode as much as we did recording it!<br/> <br/> Tell us what you think about the episode, we&#39;d love to hear from you and continue the discussion with you telling us about your experience with engineering managers.

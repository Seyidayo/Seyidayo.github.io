"Hey, there team ITT!<br/> <br/> Chuka and Emmanuel here 👋🏿. We just wanted to do a quick check in on you, our amazing listener. We hope you&#39;ve been holding up pretty okay since you last received one of these letters.&nbsp;We wanted to make a quick announcement: there will be no episodes today and we will be taking a short break from releasing episodes this June.<br/> <br/> We&#39;re so grateful for all the love and support we&#39;ve received so far and that&#39;s why we&#39;re taking this time to do some re-evaluation and preparation for the future of the podcast. In the meantime, if you&#39;re a little behind on the episodes, this is your opportunity to binge listen to the episodes&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">(</span><a href=\"https://anchor.fm/insidethetechosystem\" style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-size: 16px;\">anchor.fm/insidethetechosystem</a><span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">)</span>&nbsp;you&#39;ve missed so far while you anticipate more episodes coming your way soon.

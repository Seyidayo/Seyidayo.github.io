"<div>Hey there ITT fam!<br/> <br/> Is it too late to say Happy New Year? We hope not. We have missed sending you these letters. We know it&#39;s been a while but we&#39;ve been quite busy behind the scenes, working on improving the podcast and we can&#39;t wait to show you all the things we have planned coming soon.<br/> <br/> In the meantime, we&#39;re happy to be back and to finally release our first episode of the year. In this episode, we sit down with startup founder and entrepreneur, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ebovi_wali\">Ebovi Wali</a> to discuss the exciting worlds of startups and valuations.

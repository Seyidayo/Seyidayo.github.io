"Hello Inside the Techosystem fam!<br/> <br/> We hope you&#39;ve been cautious and paying attention to the things happening in the nation. Our voices need to be heard now more than ever in order to put an End to Police Brutality in Nigeria. Protests may seem to be on hold for now but there are still many ways to lend your voices and apply pressure!<br/> â€‹Check out what some Nigerian youths are doing here: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OworoTv/status/1319897537164226560?s=19\">https://twitter.com/OworoTv/status/1319897537164226560?s=19</a><br/> <br/> That being said, we&#39;d like to note that this is an apology letter as there will be <strong>no episode this Wednesday. </strong>That&#39;s odd, yeah we know. We actually had an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndSARS?s=08\">#EndSARS</a> episode recorded and ready for release a few days ago but there was something seriously wrong with the sound quality and so we decided not to release it. We&#39;re always looking for ways to push out the best content for you, our dear listener and that episode just wasn&#39;t it.<br/> <br/> <strong>Inside the Techosystem</strong> returns next two weeks Wednesday but in the meantime, you can catch up on episodes you may have missed in the past right here: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/insidethetechos\">https://linktr.ee/insidethetechos</a><br/> <br/> You can connect with us on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/insidethetechos\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/insidethetechos\">Instagram</a> @<em>insidethetechos</em>.

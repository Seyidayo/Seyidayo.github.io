We just wanted to talk about our experiences and the experiences of others and have fun doing it. We had no idea we&#39;d be running this thing 2 years later. Seeing people talk about how helpful they&#39;ve found the podcast or how much fun they had listening to a particular episode has been enough encouragement for us to keep going.<br/> <br/> We had a lot of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/insidethetechos/status/1598339687718035456?s=20&t=l0G8kVpQvC5mJ-HkybRnkA\">good things</a> happen to the show this year and none of that would have been possible without you listening, sharing, and engaging with us. For that, we just want to say thank you again and we can&#39;t wait to see you again next year!<br/> <br/> Take a second to watch our 2022 recap video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Mv_PH6K5V4\">https://youtu.be/4Mv_PH6K5V4</a>.<br/> <br/> See you in 2023!<br/> <br/> All of us at Inside the Techosystem."

"Hello Inside the Techosystem fam!<br/> <br/> How are you doing? We hope you&#39;ve been doing okay since the last time you got one of these letters. It&#39;s yet another Wednesday of <strong>Inside the Techosystem</strong> and in this week&#39;s light sprint episode (which was recorded last year by the way) we talk about &quot;<strong>Unfinished Projects</strong>&quot;, something a lot of people in the techosystem can relate to.<br/> <br/> We regularly have ideas that we begin working on but a lot of the times never complete. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re not here to judge 😅 we just had a light discussion on the subject matter, that&#39;s all. Also, you may notice that we didn&#39;t exactly offer any solutions and that&#39;s because, in truth, unfinished projects have their own advantages👀. To learn more about this, plug in your earphones and listen to the episode.<br/> <br/> If you like, you can tell us stories of your own unfinished projects, reply to this mail. We&#39;d love to hear them and also laugh with you 😁.<br/> <br/> You can listen to the episode here: <a href=\"http://anchor.fm/insidethetechosystem\">anchor.fm/insidethetechosystem</a>.<br/> <br/> You can connect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/insidethetechos\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://instagram.com/insidethetechos\">Instagram</a> @insidethetechos.
